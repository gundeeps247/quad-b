# Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration

## Overview

This project is an advanced To-Do application built with ReactJS, demonstrating key skills in frontend development, API integration, and state management using Redux. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Input new tasks into a text field and add them to the list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all added tasks in a list format.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the list with a delete button.
- **Task Prioritization**: Set and display task priorities (High, Medium, Low).
- **Persistent Storage**: Save tasks and authentication status using local storage.
- **User Authentication**: Simulated login/logout functionality with Redux.
- **API Integration**: Display data from a public API (e.g., weather conditions for outdoor tasks).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface with functional components and hooks.
- **Redux**: For state management and handling asynchronous actions using Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
