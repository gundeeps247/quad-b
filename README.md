# Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration

## Overview

This project is an advanced To-Do application built with ReactJS, demonstrating key skills in frontend development, API integration, and state management using Redux. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Input new tasks into a text field and add them to the list.
- **View Tasks**: Display all added tasks in a list format.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the list with a delete button.
- **Task Prioritization**: Set and display task priorities (High, Medium, Low).
